# IBM_Excel_Basics_For_Data_Analysis

Welcome to my Excel Portolfio!

In this portfolio, i have included a variety of tasks and projects i had completed as part of the IBM Excel course. Some of the Excel features i have explored include cleaning data, creating Pivot tables and charts, Conditional formatting, managing large datasets with functions (i.e. IF, SUM, AVERAGE, MIN, MAX, COUNT, VLOOKUP) and manipulating data.
